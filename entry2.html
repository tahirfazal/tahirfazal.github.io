<h1>Get shit done</h1>
<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>The irony of not posting during a month after having posted stuff about perseverance is hilarious. My apologies for that. </p>
<p>Since I feel quite down on my productivity activities during this month (having also bought a PS4 and FIFA 18), I would like to share the following video in order to keep this post short and straight. If it wasnâ€™t for it I would have not started writing this very article:</p>

<p>I hope it helps you all do whatever you should be doing instead of reading my blog! And I hope to be writing anytime soon to launch this website into a .com domain. </p>
